# DEVTEST
This program is written in Python 3.7.9. 
The main point to acheive is to code a monitor that uses a path from my local computer and look for files to divide into two categories "xls*" files and "others". 

Both will be divided in to two folders that will be created on runtime called "processed" and "not applicable". 

And the "processed" files, the monitor, will take each sheet of the files and consolidate them on a master workbook file (where a copy from each sheet will also appear in this master workbook file).
